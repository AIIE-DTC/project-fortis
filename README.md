## Whatâ€™s Inside?

The tools used by Fortis are subject to change.
Currently it the front-end interface is a thin layer on top of many amazing community projects, such as:

* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) with [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server), [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) and [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader)
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) with ES6 and extensions used by Facebook (JSX, [object spread](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread/commits/master), [class properties](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-class-public-fields))
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
* [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest)
* [recharts](http://recharts.org)
* [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
